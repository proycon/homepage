  describe a system capable of translating native language (L1)
  fragments to foreign language (L2) fragments in an L2
  context. Practical applications of this research can be framed in
  the context of second language learning.  The type of translation
  assistance system under investigation here encourages language
  learners to write in their target language while allowing them to
  fall back to their native language in case the correct word or
  expression is not known. These code switches are subsequently
  translated to L2 given the L2 context.  We study the
  feasibility of exploiting cross-lingual context to obtain
  high-quality translation suggestions that improve over statistical
  language modelling and word-sense disambiguation baselines. A
  classification-based approach is presented that is indeed found to
  improve significantly over these baselines by making use of a
  contextual window spanning a small number of neighbouring words.}

 abstract = {T-Scan is a new tool for analyzing Dutch text.  It aims at extracting text features that are
theoretically interesting, in that they relate to genre and text complexity, as well as practically
interesting, in that they enable users and text producers to make text-specific diagnoses. T-Scan
derives it features from tools such as Frog and Alpino, and resources such as SoNaR, SUBTLEX-NL
and Referentie Bestand Nederlands.
This paper offers a qualitative discussion of a number of T-Scan features, based on a minimal
demonstration corpus of six texts, three of them scientific articles and three of them drawn from
a women’s magazine.  We discuss features concerning lexical complexity, sentence complexity,
referential cohesion and lexical diversity, lexical semantics and personal style. For all these domains
we examine the construct validity as well as the reliability of a number of important features.
We conclude that T-Scan offers a number of promising lexical and syntactic features, while the
interpretation of referential cohesion/ lexical diversity features and personal style features is less
clear. Further developing the application and analyzing authentic text need to go hand in hand.}

 abstract = {In this paper we present FoLiA, a Format for Linguistic Annotation, and conduct a comparative
study with other annotation schemes, including the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF), the
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Text Corpus Format (TCF). An additional point of focus is
the interoperability between FoLiA and metadata standards such as the Component MetaData
Infrastructure (CMDI), as well as data category registries such as ISOcat. The aim of the paper
is to present a clear image of the capabilities of FoLiA and how it relates to other formats. This
should open discussion and aid users in their decision for a particular format.
FoLiA is a practically-oriented XML-based annotation format for the representation of language resources, explicitly supporting a wide variety of annotation types. It introduces a flexible
and uniform paradigm and a representation independent of language or label set. It is designed to
be highly expressive, generic, and formalised, whilst at the same time focussing on being as practical as possible to ease its adoption and implementation. The aspiration is to offer a generic format
for storage, exchange, and machine-processing of linguistically annotated documents, preventing
users as well as software tools from having to cope with a wide variety of different formats, which in
the field regularly causes convertibility issues and proliferation of ad-hoc formats. FoLiA emerged
from such a practical need in the context of Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands and
Flanders. It has been successfully adopted by numerous projects within this community. FoLiA
was developed in a bottom-up fashion, with special emphasis on software libraries and tools to
handle it.}

The system closely resembles our winning system for the same task in SemEval 2010. It is based on k-nearest neighbour classifiers which map words with local and global context features onto their transla tion, i.e.  their cross-lingual sense.  The system participated in the task for all five languages and obtained winning scores for four of them when asked to predict the best translation(s). We tested various configurations of our system, focusing on various levels of hyperparameter optimisation and feature selection.  Our final results indicate that hyperparameter optimisation did not lead to the best results, indicating overfitting by our optimisation method in this aspect. Feature selection does have a modest positive impact.}

to the duration in time as well to the budget, employing current state-of-the-art tools, standards and best practices. By doing so we aim to
pass on insights that may be beneficial for anyone considering to undertake an effort towards building a large, varied yet balanced corpus
for use by the wider research community. Various issues are discussed that come into play while compiling a large corpus, including
approaches to acquiring texts, the arrangement of IPR, the choice of text formats, and steps to be taken in the preprocessing of data from
widely different origins. We describe FoLiA, a new XML format geared at rich linguistic annotations. We also explain the rationale
behind the investment in the high-quality semi-automatic enrichment of a relatively small (1 MW) subset with very rich syntactic and
semantic annotations. Finally, we present some ideas about future developments and the direction corpus development may take, such
as setting up an integrated work flow between web services and the potential role for ISOcat. We list tips for potential corpus builders,
tricks they may want to try and further recommendations regarding technical developments future corpus builders may wish to hope for.}

In order to overcome this data bottleneck, the DutchSemCor project will deliver a Dutch corpus that is sense-tagged with senses from the Cornetto lexical database. Part of this corpus (circa 300K examples) is manually tagged. The remainder is automatically tagged using different WSD systems and validated by human annotators. The project uses existing corpora compiled in other projects; these are extended with Internet
examples f or word senses that are less frequent and do not (sufficiently) appear in the corpora. We report on the status of the
project and the evaluations of the WSD systems with the current training data.}

compare three methods of phrase extraction, and present a new decoder that reassembles the trans-
lated fragments into one final translation. Results show that one of the proposed phrase-extraction
methods—the one used in Moses—leads to a translation system that outperforms context-sensitive
word-based approaches. The differences, however, are small, arguably because the word-based ap-
proaches already capture phrasal context implicitly due to their source-side and target-side context
sensitivity.}
