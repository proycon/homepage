The translation system is built around the open-source SMT software Moses. The resulting system, named Oersetter , is released as a website for human end users, as well as a web service  for  software  to  interact  with.  We  here  discuss  the  workings,  setup and performance of our system, which to our knowledge is the very first Frisian-Dutch SMT system.},

Translating L1 fragments in an L2 context allows language learners when writing  in  a  target  language  (L2)  to  fall back to their native language (L1) whenever they are uncertain of the right word or phrase.},

  abstract={Counting n-grams lies at the core of any frequentist corpus analysis and is often considered a trivial matter. Going
beyond consecutive n-grams to patterns such as skipgrams and flexgrams increases the demand for efficient solutions. The
need to operate on big corpus data does so even more. Lossless compression and non-trivial algorithms are needed to
lower the memory demands, yet retain good speed. Colibri Core is software for the efficient computation and querying of
n-grams, skipgrams and flexgrams from corpus data. The resulting pattern models can be analysed and compared in various
ways. The software offers a programming library for C++ and Python, as well as command-line tools.}
