 abstract = {The idea behind the Flemish/Dutch CLARIN project TTNWW¹ (’TST Tools voor het Nederlands als Webservices in een Workflow’, or ‘NLP Tools for Dutch as Web services in a Workflow’) was that many end users of resources and tools offered by CLARIN will not know how to use them, just as they will not know where they are located. With respect to the location, the CLARIN policy is that the Human and Social Sciences (HSS) researcher does not need to know this as the infrastructure will take care of that: the only thing the user needs to do is to indicate},
