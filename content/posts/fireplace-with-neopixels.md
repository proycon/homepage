# Fireplace with Raspberry Pi and Neopixels

Electronic fireplace, powered by a Raspberry Pi and Neopixel LED-strip. Fully integrated into our homeautomation system. The colour representation in the video is a bit off, it's looks less red in reality. See [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi?view=all)
