In tribute to the Battlestar Galactica Sci-fi series and the wonderful music in it by composer Bear McCreary, here is my Battlestar Galactica Composition, in which the true BSG fan will be able to discern part a few of the melodies heard in the series: - Intro - The shape of things to come - Allegro - Passacaglia - All along the Watchtower / Kara Remembers - The original 1978 theme song Played in part by ear and in part using Bear McCreary's fantastic piano solo book (featured on the piano in the video).
