+++

There seems to be a bit of a hype going currently amongst bloggers where people post
what their so-called *"default apps"* or mostly used applications are, apparently
prompted by [this podcast](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) and [Robb Knight's list
](https://defaults.rknight.me/).

I see most of the participants posting a variety of often Apple-based
proprietary software. I thought I'd join in on the fun from a purely FOSS (Free
Open Source Software) perspective. I have a strong preference for minimalistic
local-first software following the UNIX philosophy (do one thing only, do it well, and interconnect), and often prefer
terminal-based interfaces. I want to show that you can perfectly use FOSS tools
for all your everyday needs!
