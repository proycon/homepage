# Gaeta's Lament

Here I play the wonderful song Gaeta's Lament, composed by Bear McCreary for the Battlestar Galactica TV series. In the series it is beautifully sung by Mr. Gaeta after his leg has been cut off. Unfortunately, I'm not a great singer so you'll have to do with an instrumental version.
