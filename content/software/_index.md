# Software

Iâ€™m an avid support of *open-source software*, also known as free software (free as in free speech), and have published a
lot thereof. Most of my software is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/proycon) and [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon). I also maintain packages for Arch Linux, Debian and Alpine Linux. I am active
in promoting good research software quality & sustainability. These latest years, I have a tendency to favour more
minimalistic software, as there is a lot of bloated unmaintable software and needless complexity around. One of the
things of paramount importance for me, is that *you* are in control of your own software, and that it doesn't compromise
your privacy or security.

My main programming languages are Python, Rust, C, C++, shell scripting, and javascript.
