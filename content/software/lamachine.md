LaMachine is a unified software distribution for Natural Language Processing. We integrate numerous open-source NLP
tools, programming libraries, web-services, and web-applications in a single Virtual Research Environment that can be
installed on a wide variety of machines.

The software included in LaMachine tends to be highly specialised and generally depends on a lot of other interdependent
software. Installing all this software can be a daunting task, compiling it from scratch even more so. LaMachine
attempts to make this process easier by offering pre-built recipes for a wide variety of systems, whether it is on your
home computer or whether you are setting up a dedicated production environment, LaMachine will safe you a lot of work.

We address various audiences; the bulk of the software is geared towards data scientists who are not afraid of the
command line and some programming. We give you the instruments and it is up to you to yield them. However, we also
attempt to accommodate researchers that require more high-level interfaces by incorporating webservices and websites
that expose some of the functionality to a larger audience.
