# wvkbd: On-screen keyboard for wl-roots

This project aims to deliver a minimal but practically usable implementation of a wlroots on-screen keyboard in legible C. 

It is not my original work. The project was started by John Sullivan. I and other Sxmo developers extended it and took over maintainership.
