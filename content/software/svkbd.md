# SVKBD: Simple Virtual Keyboard

This is a simple virtual keyboard, intended to be used in environments, where no physical keyboard is available.

This is a [suckless](https://suckless.org) tool and is not my original work, I simply extended this software with a lot
of functionality needed for [sxmo](/software/sxmo/), a mobile environment for the pinephone.
