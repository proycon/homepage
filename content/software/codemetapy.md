# CodeMetaPy

The goal of CodeMetaPy is to generate the JSON-LD file, codemeta.json containing software metadata describing a Python package. For more general information about the CodeMeta Project for defining software metadata, see https://codemeta.github.io. In particular, new users might want to start with the User Guide, while those looking to learn more about JSON-LD and consuming existing codemeta files should see the Developer Guide.
