Clickclack is a simple haptic feedback and audio feedback tool. It does nothing more than emulate the clickclack sound and vibration when pressing keys.

This tools reads from standard input and emits a vibration and/or a sound whenever it receives a character. It is intented to be used in combination with a virtual keyboard like [svkbd](https://tools.suckless.org/x/svkbd) (X11) or [wvkbd](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/wvkbd) (wayland).
