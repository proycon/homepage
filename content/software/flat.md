# FLAT

FLAT is a web-based linguistic annotation environment based around the FoLiA format (http://proycon.github.io/folia), a rich XML-based format for linguistic annotation. FLAT allows users to view annotated FoLiA documents and enrich these documents with new annotations, a wide variety of linguistic annotation types is supported through the FoLiA paradigm. It is a document-centric tool that fully preserves and visualises document structure.

FLAT is written in Python using the Django framework. The user interface is written using javascript with jquery. The FoLiA Document Server (https://github.com/proycon/foliadocserve) , the back-end of the system, is written in Python with CherryPy and is used as a RESTful webservice.

FLAT is open source software developed at the Centre of Language and Speech Technology, Radboud University Nijmegen. It is licensed under the GNU Public License v3. The project is funded in the scope of the larger CLARIAH project.
