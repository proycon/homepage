# Sxmo: Simple X Mobile

**Sxmo**, or Simple X Mobile, is a collection of simple and [suckless](http://suckless.org) X programs and scripts used together to create a fully
functional mobile UI adhering to the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) for the [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/). You control the UI largely through using the
Pinephone buttons (press different numbers of times quickly for different actions) and swipe gestures.

This software project is an initiative by [Miles Alan](http://milesalan.com/). I contributed in certain areas and am
currently a co-maintainer of this project.

Check out the [demo video](/posts/sxmo-demo-video/) I made to get an impression of this software.
