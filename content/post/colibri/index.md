My PhD thesis *Constructions as Linguistic Bridges* has been released and is to be defended soon:

Context as Linguistic Bridges is a study that focusses on the role of context information in machine translation, i.e.
automated translation by computers.  The underlying intuition is that the context in which a word or phrase appears is
an important cue for the translation of that word or phrase. Consider, for example, the two different meanings of the word
*bank* in the sentences *I put my money on the bank* and *The ship got stuck on the bank*

We developed classifier-based solutions that work well in Word Sense Disambiguation tasks like the above example, and
integrate these in a Statistical Machine Translation system.  Our main question is to find to what extent can we improve
automated translation by explicitly modelling such context information.
