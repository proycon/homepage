The goal of DutchSemCor was to deliver a one-million word Dutch corpus that is fully sense-tagged with senses and domain
tags from the Cornetto database (STEVIN project STE05039). 250K words of this corpus were manually tagged. The remainder
was automatically tagged using three different word-sense-disambiguation systems (WSD), and was validated by human
annotators. The corpus data is based on existing corpus material collected in the projects CGN, D-CoI and SoNaR. The
corpora were extended where necessary to find sufficient examples for meanings of words that are less frequent and do
not appear in the above corpora. The resulting corpus, for which we aimed to offer the same balance in types of text as
these basic resources, is extremely rich in terms of lexical semantic information. Its availability enables many new
lines of research and technology developments for the Dutch language.

I worked on this project from 2009 to 2011.
