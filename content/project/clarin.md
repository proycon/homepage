The CLARIN-NL project is a large national project in the Netherlands (2009-2015) which aims to make a significant
contribution to the European CLARIN infrastructure.  The CLARIN infrastructure is a research infrastructure intended for
humanities researchers that work with language data and tools. The researcher will be able to find data and tools
relevant for his/her research via the CLARIN infrastructure and get access to them. We also aim to make it possible to
apply tools to data in such a way that no technical background is needed or ad-hoc adaptations to the tools or the data
are necessary.

The researcherâ€™s research project may result in new data and tools, which he/she can make available to other researchers
via the CLARIN infrastructure. The CLARIN research infrastructure will thus make humanities research related to language
easier, faster, better, and in some cases even possible for the first time.
