# Language Learning

## UniLang

[UniLang](https://unilang.org) is a online language learning community I
co-founded in 2000 with Erik Zidowecki (Abavagada), (proycon) and Niels van
Bellingen (Silvah). This makes us one of the first language communities on the
world wide web.  Our efforts have been rewarded with a small appearance in a
BBC World television show and we have been a finalist in the Stockholm
Challenge for innovative ICT projects. We were a very active community of
polyglots and language-entusiasists, especially in the mid-2000s.

I and others developed many language learning resources at the time, and talked
with one another on our [forum](https://forum.unilang.org) and chat. Although
the chat has been decommissioned, but the forum is still alive and active to
this day!
