 abstract = {The idea behind the Flemish/Dutch CLARIN project TTNWW¹ (’TST Tools voor het Nederlands als Webservices in een Workflow’, or ‘NLP Tools for Dutch as Web services in a Workflow’) was that many end users of resources and tools offered by CLARIN will not know how to use them, just as they will not know where they are located.
