abstract: "We present an overview of the software and data infrastructure for FoLiA, a Format for Linguistic Annotation developed within the scope of the CLARIN-NL project and other projects.  FoLiA aims to provide a single unified file format accommodating a wide variety of linguistic annotation types, preventing the proliferation of different formats for different annotation types. FoLiA is being developed in a bottom-up and practice-driven fashion.  We have invested mainly in the creation of a rich infrastructure of tools that enable developers and end-users to work with the format. This work will present the current state of this infrastructure."
