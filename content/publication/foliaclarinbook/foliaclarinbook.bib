 abstract = {We present an overview of the software and data infrastructure for FoLiA, a
Format for Linguistic Annotation developed within the
scope of the CLARIN-NL project and other projects.  FoLiA aims to provide a
single unified file format accommodating a wide variety of linguistic
annotation types, preventing the proliferation of different formats for
different annotation types. FoLiA is being developed in a bottom-up and
practice-driven fashion.  We have invested mainly in the creation of a rich
infrastructure of tools that enable developers and end-users to work with the
format. This work will present the current state of this infrastructure.},
