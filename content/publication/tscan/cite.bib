@article{TSCAN,
 abstract = {T-Scan is a new tool for analyzing Dutch text.  It aims at extracting text features that are
theoretically interesting, in that they relate to genre and text complexity, as well as practically
interesting, in that they enable users and text producers to make text-specific diagnoses. T-Scan
derives it features from tools such as Frog and Alpino, and resources such as SoNaR, SUBTLEX-NL
and Referentie Bestand Nederlands.
This paper offers a qualitative discussion of a number of T-Scan features, based on a minimal
demonstration corpus of six texts, three of them scientific articles and three of them drawn from
a womenâ€™s magazine.  We discuss features concerning lexical complexity, sentence complexity,
referential cohesion and lexical diversity, lexical semantics and personal style. For all these domains
we examine the construct validity as well as the reliability of a number of important features.
We conclude that T-Scan offers a number of promising lexical and syntactic features, while the
interpretation of referential cohesion/ lexical diversity features and personal style features is less
clear. Further developing the application and analyzing authentic text need to go hand in hand.},
