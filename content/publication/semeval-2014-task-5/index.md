abstract = "We  present  a  new  cross-lingual  task  for SemEval   concerning   the   translation   of L1  fragments  in  an  L2  context.  The task  is  at  the  boundary  of  Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Machine Translation.  It finds its application in the field of computer-assisted translation, particularly in the context of second language learning.  Translating L1 fragments in an L2 context allows language learners when writing  in  a  target  language  (L2)  to  fall back to their native language (L1) whenever they are uncertain of the right word or phrase."
