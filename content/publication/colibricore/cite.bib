 abstract = {Counting n-grams lies at the core of any frequentist corpus analysis and is often considered a trivial matter. Going
beyond consecutive n-grams to patterns such as skipgrams and flexgrams increases the demand for efficient solutions. The
need to operate on big corpus data does so even more. Lossless compression and non-trivial algorithms are needed to
lower the memory demands, yet retain good speed. Colibri Core is software for the efficient computation and querying of
n-grams, skipgrams and flexgrams from corpus data. The resulting pattern models can be analysed and compared in various
ways. The software offers a programming library for C++ and Python, as well as command-line tools.},
