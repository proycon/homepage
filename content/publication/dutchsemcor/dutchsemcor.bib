 abstract = {State of the art Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems require large sense-tagged corpora along with lexical databases to
reach satisfactory results. The number of English language resources for developed WSD increased in the past years, while most
other languages are still under-resourced. The situation is no different for Dutch. In order to overcome this data bottleneck, the DutchSemCor project will deliver a Dutch corpus that is sense-tagged with senses from the Cornetto lexical database. Part of this corpus (circa 300K examples) is manually tagged. The remainder is automatically tagged using different WSD systems and validated by human annotators. The project uses existing corpora compiled in other projects; these are extended with Internet
examples f or word senses that are less frequent and do not (sufficiently) appear in the corpora. We report on the status of the
project and the evaluations of the WSD systems with the current training data.},
