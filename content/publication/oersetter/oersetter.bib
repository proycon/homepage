 abstract = {In  this  paper  we  present  a  statistical  machine  translation  (SMT)  system  for Frisian to Dutch and Dutch to Frisian. A parallel training corpus has been  established,  which  has  subsequently  been  used  to  automatically  learn a phrase-based SMT model. The translation system is built around the open-source SMT software Moses. The resulting system, named Oersetter , is released as a website for human end users, as well as a web service  for  software  to  interact  with.  We  here  discuss  the  workings,  setup and performance of our system, which to our knowledge is the very first Frisian-Dutch SMT system.},
