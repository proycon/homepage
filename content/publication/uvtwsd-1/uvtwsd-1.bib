 abstract = {This paper describes the Cross-Lingual
Word Sense Disambiguation system UvT-WSD1, developed at Tilburg University,
for participation in two SemEval-2 tasks:
the Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task and the Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution task. The UvT-WSD1
system makes use of k-nearest neighbour classifiers, in the form of single-word experts for each target word to be disam-
biguated. These classifiers can be constructed using a variety of local and global
context features, and these are mapped onto the translations, i.e. the senses,
of the words. The system works for a given language-pair, either English-Dutch
or English-Spanish in the current implementation, and takes a word-aligned parallel corpus as its input.},
