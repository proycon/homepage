 abstract = {In this paper we present new research in translation assistance. We
describe a system capable of translating native language (L1)
fragments to foreign language (L2) fragments in an L2
context. Practical applications of this research can be framed in
the context of second language learning.  The type of translation
assistance system under investigation here encourages language
learners to write in their target language while allowing them to
fall back to their native language in case the correct word or
expression is not known. These code switches are subsequently
translated to L2 given the L2 context.  We study the
feasibility of exploiting cross-lingual context to obtain
high-quality translation suggestions that improve over statistical
language modelling and word-sense disambiguation baselines. A
classification-based approach is presented that is indeed found to
improve significantly over these baselines by making use of a
contextual window spanning a small number of neighbouring words.},
