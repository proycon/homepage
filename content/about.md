## About me

I am **Maarten van Gompel**, also known as **proycon** on the internet. Welcome to my homepage where I share some of my work and interests.
I live in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with my boyfriend Hans and our dog Jaiko. I work as a research software
engineer (just a fancy word for computer programmer) in the field of Natural Language Processing at the KNAW Humanities
Cluster and at Radboud University (Nijmegen). I'm also active in the Free and Open Source Software community.

I am very passionate about both languages and technology, and especially those areas where they meet!
