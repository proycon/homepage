## Contact information

You can contact me via e-mail or chat, the former is usually preferred for
longer messages. Below is a list of all the ways you can reach me.

We can also arrange a video conference if you want, please contact me via e-mail first.

**Technical note:** I strongly believe in using open and decentralised technologies for
communication, so I do not use Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, WhatsApp,
WeChat/微信, etc... Telegram is the only concession in this list and is not the preferred option.
You can import my [🔑 GnuPG key](/key.asc) for
end-to-end encryption via mail. You can also import all my contact details at
once (e.g. into your smartphone) via my [📇 vCard](http://127.0.0.1:1111/proycon.vcf).

Feel free to write in any of the languages I can speak! (🇳🇱 Nederlands,  🇬🇧English,  🇪🇸 Español, 🇧🇷 Português, 🇫🇷 Français, 🇩🇪 Deutsch, Esperanto, 🇮🇹 Italiano, 🇷🇺 Русский, 🇨🇳 汉语)
