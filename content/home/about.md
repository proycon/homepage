# About me

I am **Maarten van Gompel**, also known as **proycon** on the internet. Welcome to my site where I share some of my work and interests.
I live in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with my boyfriend Hans, our cat Sam and our dog Jaiko. I am a research software
engineer (just a fancy word for computer programmer) in the field of Natural Language Processing at the Radboud University, in
Nijmegen.
