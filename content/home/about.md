# About me

I am **Maarten van Gompel**, also known as **proycon** on the internet. Welcome to my homepage where I share some of my work and interests.
I live in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with my boyfriend Hans and our dog Jaiko. I am a research software
engineer (just a fancy word for computer programmer) in the field of Natural Language Processing at the Radboud University, in
Nijmegen.

I am very passionate about both languages and technology, and especially those areas where they meet!
