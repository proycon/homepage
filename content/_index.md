*Hello! Hallo! ¡Hola! Olá! Salut! Ciao! Saluton! Привет! 大家好！ السلام عليكم*

My name is **Maarten van Gompel**, also known as **proycon** on the internet. Welcome to my homepage where I share some
of my work and interests. I live in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with my boyfriend Hans and our dog Jaiko. I have a great
passion for languages and technology, and especially those areas where they meet!

I work as a research software engineer (just a fancy word for computer programmer) in the field of Natural Language
Processing. I'm a unix enthusiast committed to open-source software and an advocate for more security, simplicity,
privacy and decentralisation. I love learning languages, coding, reading (mostly science fiction), working on my home
automation system, playing the piano, and walking our dog.

If you want to follow me on social media and/or react publicly to anything on this page, then my [Mastodon](https://social.anaproy.nl/@proycon) profile on the fediverse is the best option. I occasionally post something there about stuff that interests me.  For longer blog posts, however, this website is the place to be, you can also follow those via my [rss feed](/index.xml).
