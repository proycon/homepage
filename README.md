## Run development server

``$ zola serve``

## Deploy

``$ ./deploy.sh``

``$ ./updatebib.sh``

Relies on pandoc-citeproc for conversion of bibtex to json, which is in turn interpreted by a template.

Also relies on bib2xml and xml2ris for conversion to RIS (not actually used by the website).

## Add photo

``$ ./addphoto.sh $photo "caption"``
