    "abstract": "We present the Tool Discovery pipeline, a core component of the CLARIAH infrastructure in the Netherlands. This pipeline harvests software metadata from the source, detects existing heterogeneous metadata formats already in use by software developers, and converts them to a single uniform representation based on schema.org and codemeta. The resulting data is then made available for further ingestion into other user-facing catalogue/portal systems.",

    "abstract": "We describe ongoing work for developing a workflow for the applied use case of classifying diachronic and regional language variation in Pre-Modern Slavic texts. The data were obtained via handwritten text recognition (HTR) on medieval manuscripts and printings and partly by manual transcription. Our goal is to develop a workflow for such historical language data, covering HTR-postprocessing, annotating and classifying the digitized texts. We test and adapt existing language resources to fit the pipeline with low-barrier tooling, accessible for Humanists with limited experience in research data infrastructures, computational analysis or advanced methods of natural language processing (NLP). The workflow starts by addressing ground truth (GT) data creation for diagnosing and correcting HTR errors via string metrics and data-driven methods. On GT and on HTR data, we subsequently show classification results using transfer learning on sentence-level text snippets. Next, we report on our token-level data labeling efforts. Each step of the workflow is complemented with describing current limitations and our corresponding work in progress.",

FoLiA aims to provide a single unified file format accommodating a wide variety of linguistic annotation types, preventing the proliferation of different formats for different annotation types. FoLiA is being developed in a bottom-up and practice-driven fashion. We have invested mainly in the creation of a rich infrastructure of tools that enable developers and end-users to work with the format. This work will present the current state of this infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are known as a ’pain in the neck’ due to their idiosyncratic behaviour. While some categories of MWEs have been largely studied, verbal MWEs (VMWEs) such as to take a walk, to break one’s heart or to turn off have been relatively rarely modelled. We describe an initiative meant to bring about substantial progress in understanding, modelling and processing VMWEs. In this joint effort carried out within a European research network we elaborated a universal terminology and annotation methodology for VMWEs. Its main outcomes, available under open licenses, are unified annotation guidelines, and a corpus of over 5.4 million words and 62 thousand annotated VMWEs in 18 languages.",

    "abstract": "Counting n-grams lies at the core of any frequentist corpus analysis and is often considered a trivial matter. Going beyond consecutive n-grams to patterns such as skipgrams and flexgrams increases the demand for efficient solutions. The need to operate on big corpus data does so even more. Lossless compression and non-trivial algorithms are needed to lower the memory demands, yet retain good speed. Colibri Core is software for the efficient computation and querying of n-grams, skipgrams and flexgrams from corpus data. The resulting pattern models can be analysed and compared in various ways. The software offers a programming library for C++ and Python, as well as command-line tools.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research relies on computer software, yet software is not always developed following practices that ensure its quality and sustainability. This manuscript does not aim to propose new software development best practices, but rather to provide simple recommendations that encourage the adoption of existing best practices. Software development best practices promote better quality software, and better quality software improves the reproducibility and reusability of research. These recommendations are designed around Open Source values, and provide practical suggestions that contribute to making research software and its source code more discoverable, reusable and transparent. This manuscript is aimed at developers, but also at organisations, projects, journals and funders that can increase the quality and sustainability of research software by encouraging the adoption of these recommendations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present new research in translation assistance. We describe a system capable of translating native language (L1) fragments to foreign language (L2) fragments in an L2 context. Practical applications of this research can be framed in the context of second language learning. The type of translation assistance system under investigation here encourages language learners to write in their target language while allowing them to fall back to their native language in case the correct word or expression is not known. These code switches are subsequently translated to L2 given the L2 context. We study the feasibility of exploiting cross-lingual context to obtain high-quality translation suggestions that improve over statistical language modelling and word-sense disambiguation baselines. A classification-based approach is presented that is indeed found to improve significantly over these baselines by making use of a contextual window spanning a small number of neighbouring words.",

    "abstract": "T-Scan is a new tool for analyzing Dutch text. It aims at extracting text features that are theoretically interesting, in that they relate to genre and text complexity, as well as practically interesting, in that they enable users and text producers to make text-specific diagnoses. T-Scan derives it features from tools such as Frog and Alpino, and resources such as SoNaR, SUBTLEX-NL and Referentie Bestand Nederlands. This paper offers a qualitative discussion of a number of T-Scan features, based on a minimal demonstration corpus of six texts, three of them scientific articles and three of them drawn from a women’s magazine. We discuss features concerning lexical complexity, sentence complexity, referential cohesion and lexical diversity, lexical semantics and personal style. For all these domains we examine the construct validity as well as the reliability of a number of important features. We conclude that T-Scan offers a number of promising lexical and syntactic features, while the interpretation of referential cohesion/ lexical diversity features and personal style features is less clear. Further developing the application and analyzing authentic text need to go hand in hand.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present FoLiA, a Format for Linguistic Annotation, and conduct a comparative study with other annotation schemes, including the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF), the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Text Corpus Format (TCF). An additional point of focus is the interoperability between FoLiA and metadata standards such as the Component MetaData Infrastructure (CMDI), as well as data category registries such as ISOcat. The aim of the paper is to present a clear image of the capabilities of FoLiA and how it relates to other formats. This should open discussion and aid users in their decision for a particular format. FoLiA is a practically-oriented XML-based annotation format for the representation of language resources, explicitly supporting a wide variety of annotation types. It introduces a flexible and uniform paradigm and a representation independent of language or label set. It is designed to be highly expressive, generic, and formalised, whilst at the same time focussing on being as practical as possible to ease its adoption and implementation. The aspiration is to offer a generic format for storage, exchange, and machine-processing of linguistically annotated documents, preventing users as well as software tools from having to cope with a wide variety of different formats, which in the field regularly causes convertibility issues and proliferation of ad-hoc formats. FoLiA emerged from such a practical need in the context of Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands and Flanders. It has been successfully adopted by numerous projects within this community. FoLiA was developed in a bottom-up fashion, with special emphasis on software libraries and tools to handle it.",

The system closely resembles our winning system for the same task in SemEval 2010. It is based on k-nearest neighbour classifiers which map words with local and global context features onto their transla tion, i.e. their cross-lingual sense. The system participated in the task for all five languages and obtained winning scores for four of them when asked to predict the best translation(s). We tested various configurations of our system, focusing on various levels of hyperparameter optimisation and feature selection. Our final results indicate that hyperparameter optimisation did not lead to the best results, indicating overfitting by our optimisation method in this aspect. Feature selection does have a modest positive impact.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we report on the experiences gained in the recent construction of the SoNaR corpus, a 500 MW reference corpus of contemporary, written Dutch. It shows what can realistically be done within the confines of a project setting where there are limitations to the duration in time as well to the budget, employing current state-of-the-art tools, standards and best practices. By doing so we aim to pass on insights that may be beneficial for anyone considering to undertake an effort towards building a large, varied yet balanced corpus for use by the wider research community. Various issues are discussed that come into play while compiling a large corpus, including approaches to acquiring texts, the arrangement of IPR, the choice of text formats, and steps to be taken in the preprocessing of data from widely different origins. We describe FoLiA, a new XML format geared at rich linguistic annotations. We also explain the rationale behind the investment in the high-quality semi-automatic enrichment of a relatively small (1 MW) subset with very rich syntactic and semantic annotations. Finally, we present some ideas about future developments and the direction corpus development may take, such as setting up an integrated work flow between web services and the potential role for ISOcat. We list tips for potential corpus builders, tricks they may want to try and further recommendations regarding technical developments future corpus builders may wish to hope for.",

    "abstract": "State of the art Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems require large sense-tagged corpora along with lexical databases to reach satisfactory results. The number of English language resources for developed WSD increased in the past years, while most other languages are still under-resourced. The situation is no different for Dutch. In order to overcome this data bottleneck, the DutchSemCor project will deliver a Dutch corpus that is sense-tagged with senses from the Cornetto lexical database. Part of this corpus (circa 300K examples) is manually tagged. The remainder is automatically tagged using different WSD systems and validated by human annotators. The project uses existing corpora compiled in other projects; these are extended with Internet examples f or word senses that are less frequent and do not (sufficiently) appear in the corpora. We report on the status of the project and the evaluations of the WSD systems with the current training data.",

The UvT-WSD1 system makes use of k-nearest neighbour classifiers, in the form of single-word experts for each target word to be disam- biguated. These classifiers can be constructed using a variety of local and global context features, and these are mapped onto the translations, i.e. the senses, of the words. The system works for a given language-pair, either English-Dutch or English-Spanish in the current implementation, and takes a word-aligned parallel corpus as its input.",

    "abstract": "We present a phrase-based extension to memory-based machine translation. This form of example- based machine translation employs lazy-learning classifiers to translate fragments of the source sen- tence to fragments of the target sentence. Source-side fragments consist of variable-length phrases in a local context of neighboring words, translated by the classifier to a target-language phrase. We compare three methods of phrase extraction, and present a new decoder that reassembles the trans- lated fragments into one final translation. Results show that one of the proposed phrase-extraction methods—the one used in Moses—leads to a translation system that outperforms context-sensitive word-based approaches. The differences, however, are small, arguably because the word-based ap- proaches already capture phrasal context implicitly due to their source-side and target-side context sensitivity.",
